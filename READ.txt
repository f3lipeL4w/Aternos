Welcome you Canadian bastards

Aujourd'hui I'll be teaching you two how to install the modpack for my MC server in a way that even a monkey would understand.

1. first make sure your Minecraft version is Forge 1.20.1
      Click Installations on the launcher start page.
      Click New. 
      In the Create new installation box, select a name for the installation and choose the game version from the VERSION list. 
      Click Create to save the change, and then click Play on the top menu.
If you don't find the right version you may not have it, in that case you can get from: 
https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.20.1.html

2.Press windows key + R to open the run tab

3. type: %appdata% and press OK

4. Congrats! you just opened you Roaming paste, now copy "mods" and "shaderpack" of my GitHub into the .minecraft file found inside the Roaming paste

5. Enter the game, go to Multiplayer and press Add Server, then type: Chinoa.aternos.me

6. Enjoy
